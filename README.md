# JavaScript Practice

All my practice for learning JavaScript.

## Project 1: Guess the number

- All HTML/CSS was provided by the instructor
- All game logic is programmed myself

### How it works

A random number is generated and you have to guess it.

If the number is higher or lower, a message will display.

Every guess, the score will decrease by 1.

If you guess the number, your highscore will eventually be updated if it is higher that your previous highscore.

You can reset the game (but not the highscore) by using the 'Again!' button in the top left corner.

### What I learned

Selecting and manipulating the DOM and implementing certain basic logic.

## Project 2: Model windows

- All HTML/CSS was provided by the instructor
- Whole script was programmed by myself

### How it works

You can open a modal window by clicking on a button.
Opening a modal window, blurs and darkens the background by adding a class.

You can close the window by:

- Clicking the X in the top right corner
- Clicking outside the modal window
- Pressing the Escape key
