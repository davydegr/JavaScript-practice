# JavaScript Practice

All my practice for learning JavaScript.

## Project 1: Guess the number

- All HTML was provided by the instructor
- All game logic is programmed myself

### How it works

A random number is generated and you have to guess it.

If the number is higher or lower, a message will display.

Every guess, the score will decrease by 1.

If you guess the number, your highscore will eventually be updated if it is higher that your previous highscore.

You can reset the game (but not the highscore) by using the 'Again!' button in the top left corner.

### What I learned

Selecting and manipulating the DOM and implementing certain basic logic.
